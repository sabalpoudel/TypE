# Interactive Code Typing Effect

This project is an interactive code typing effect generator. It allows you to input a code snippet and watch it type out dynamically, simulating the effect of a person typing code. This is useful for generating engaging reels, videos, and tutorials, particularly in a 9:16 aspect ratio, which is ideal for social media content.

## Features

- Input a code snippet and set a title.
- Adjust the font size dynamically using a slider.
- Click "Generate" to trigger the typing effect.
- Click "Stop" to pause the typing effect.
- Display the output in a 9:16 format suitable for videos and reels.

## Technologies Used
